# InspirationalQuotes
First project implemented in 2013 while learning Android development.

The idea is to make it work with current tools and updated libraries and use it as a base to learn new things and showcase my work.

## TODO
* Remove deprecated code.
* Move implementation to MVP.
* Implement DI.
* Add api https://theysaidso.com/api/ to get quote of the day.
* Add navigation drawer and move settings there.
* Add tests.
